        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first year student studying Pre-Business at the University of California, Riverside. I am taking courses that will help further my knowledge of business, coding, and other useful skills. Some of these classes include economics, calculus in business, and computer science. I hope to further expand my experience with an internship with a company that has a friendly, professional, and progressive environment. My hobbies include reading and dancing, and I am currently part of UC Riversideâ€™s very own Bollywood Dance team, UCR Afsana.

My past experience with business includes an internship with a startup based in Philadelphia, called Thrive Commerce. I qualified for the JKCP Summer Program at the University of Pennsylvania for the summer before my senior year of high school. My application was reviewed and I had to go through an interview process before I was accepted into this program. I was an intern with Thrive Commerce, where I learned about building marketing strategies for an Omni channel company that assists retailers. I helped by creating social media pages to increase outreach to new demographics, creating email sequences, gathering data to attract clients, and organizing databases within the company for prospective contacts. At the end of my time with the company, I was asked to create a hypothetical financial plan for the company to use, as well as a financial breakdown report for a prospective client of the startup. This was definitely one of the most valuable experiences I have gained in my life, and I hope to be able to use these same skills in my next internship.

Apart from this, I was also very involved at my school as a member of ASB and in the community as a volunteer. During my two years in ASB, I was an ASB officer and helped organize, plan, and execute many large events on campus.  As the ASB Activities Coordinator, it was my job to bring spirit to students during the school year through various activities. I was also in charge of leading our schoolâ€™s Leadership class and Town Hall, which informs students about the Leadership Councilâ€™s upcoming work. Additionally, I lead the schoolâ€™s Leadership class of 50 students, and lead the creation of events and dances on campus. I also participated in various District School Forums by speaking about relevant topics for teachers and students.

My involvement in my community included being a summer camp counselor, professionally trained dance instructor, tutoring AP courses, and babysitting, to name a few. These experiences all taught me responsibility, time management, and vital interpersonal skills. As a camp counselor and dance instructor, I was able to fine tune my organizational and communication skills since I was communicating daily with children of varying age groups and their parents. Additionally, working as a tutor and babysitter helped me gain one-on-one experience with people of different age groups and also gave me the skills necessary to teach new concepts to a fresh mind.

I hope that my information has stood out to you, and I am always open to further discussing any of my interests or past experiences. My contact information can be found on this website, thank you for your time!
